# Toy RUSttp

TORUS is a small, synchronous HTTP server written in Rust (by the way).

Built as a learning project and a place to experiment with low-level HTTP handling. Security is minimal, correctness is **good enough**, and polish is not the point.

Do not deploy this on the public internet unless you enjoy consequences.

*Has nice DX though...*

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic static routes  
- [ ] Dynamic routes  
- [ ] State management  
- [ ] Fewer bad ideas (unlikely)

## Non-Goals

- Be good
- Be fast
- Be secure
- Brew coffee

## Motivation

This project exists to better understand how HTTP servers work under the hood and to write flexible but intuitive Rust APIs
